InnovationBoard
===============

HTML5 Canvas Post-It and Whiteboard application. The concept is a virtual whiteboard that users can attach virtual Post-It notes to and annotate the notes and whiteboard. 

Much of Human-Centered Design and innovation techniques center around people putting ideas on Post-It notes and grouping them into categories. The hard part is transcribing the notes and annotations. Also, I wanted a way to hold innovation sessions online with remote users.
